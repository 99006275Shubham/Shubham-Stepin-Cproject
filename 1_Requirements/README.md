Requirements  

Introduction 

In this project the user will be able to go through various chapters that are mentioned in this book. It's a user-friendly book, this book contains all aspects of C programming starting from variables till Structures. As we all know that C is highly portable and is used for scripting system applications which form a major part of Windows, UNIX, and Linux operating system. C is a general-purpose programming language and can efficiently work on enterprise applications, games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations, etc. 

Objective 

The main objectives of this project are: 

  

To explain about C language like – Is a simple computer language designed to enable object-oriented programming, its defined as a small but powerful set of extensions to standard ANSI C language, its addition to C are mostly based on Smalltalk one of first OOPs language is designed to give C full OOPs programming concept, capabilities and to do so in simple and straightforward way. 

To perform operations from user and display the result.

Who 

Anyone who doesn't know basic of C language can refer this. 

  

What 

This project is concerned about C programming e-book. 

  

When 

Whenever there is a problem on C programming one can refer this e-book. 

  

Why 

As this project uses beginner's purpose, , it is easy to use and Userfriendly  

How 

Implemented using structure, pointers, Enum and other functionalities of C. 

  

Basic requirements that are very essential are: 

 1-gcc compiler with a good system. 

2-Any of the two linux/windows. 

HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS: 

High-level or Stream-level I/O 

Is more flexible and usually more convenient. 
 
 

Hides complexity from the programmer. 
 
 

When using the I/O functions high-level I/O is slower as compared to the low-level I/O. 

 

LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS: 

Provides direct access to files and devices. 
 
 

Is complex (Buffer management is to done by the programmer) 
 
 

When using I/O functions, low-level I/O is faster as compared to the high-level I/O. 
 
 

Uses a “file descriptor” to track the status of the file.
